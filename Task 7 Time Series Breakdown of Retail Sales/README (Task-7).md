# Task 7: Time Series Breakdown of Retail Sales

## Introduction
This task focuses on analysing retail sales data with the objective of exploring key external and internal factors affecting sales. The dataset contains store-level information such as temperature, fuel price, markdown campaigns, CPI, unemployment, and holiday indicators. The aim was to preprocess the data, conduct exploratory analysis, and extract meaningful insights regarding sales patterns and influencing factors.

## Dataset Overview
- **Total Records:** 8,190  
- **Number of Stores:** 45  
- **Key Features:**
  - `Store`
  - `Date`

## Analysis and Results
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to study feature distributions, missing values, and correlations.  
- Identified **seasonal patterns** influenced by holidays.  
- Analysed the impact of **external factors** such as fuel price and CPI on sales.  
- Studied the role of **markdown campaigns** in boosting store performance.
