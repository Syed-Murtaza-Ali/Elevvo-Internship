# Task 1 – Retail Sales Analysis in Excel 

## Introduction
The purpose of this analysis was to explore **retail sales data** using **Excel** and develop an **interactive dashboard** to gain insights into:
- Customer behaviour  
- Product performance  
- Regional sales distribution  

The dataset contained details such as product category, sub-category, customer details, order and ship dates, region, segment, sales value, and ship mode.

## Key Insights from Visualisations

### Sales Trends Over Time
- Sales showed clear seasonality, with certain months performing better than others.  
- The trendline indicated **steady growth** in total sales, suggesting increasing demand.  

### Sales by Region
- **West** and **East** regions contributed the highest share of total sales.  
- Central region performed moderately, while South lagged behind.  

### Sales by Category & Sub-Category
- **Technology** and **Office Supplies** were the strongest categories.  
- Within sub-categories, **Phones, Chairs, and Storage** generated the highest sales.  
- Sub-categories like **Tables** and **Binders** underperformed.  

### Top Products by Sales
- A few **top 10 products** contributed a significant portion of sales.  
- Heavy dependency on a small group of items increases business risk.  

### Sales by Segment
- **Consumer** segment was the largest contributor, followed by **Corporate**.  
- **Home Office** had the smallest share but still showed potential growth.  

### Ship Mode Analysis
- Most orders were shipped using **Standard Class**, showing preference for cost-effective delivery.  
- **Same Day** delivery had the lowest share, possibly due to higher costs or limited availability.

## Outcomes & Business Implications
1. **High Dependence on Specific Regions & Products**  
   - Expansion in weaker regions and diversification of product focus is needed.  
2. **Customer Segment Opportunities**  
   - Corporate and Home Office customers are under-utilised growth areas.  
3. **Shipping Strategy Insights**  
   - Incentives for faster shipping modes could differentiate service.  
4. **Seasonality in Sales**  
   - Seasonal campaigns can boost peak sales and stabilise low-demand months.

## Recommendations
- **Product Strategy:** Expand weaker sub-categories (e.g., Tables) through promotions/bundling.  
- **Regional Growth:** Launch targeted campaigns in the South region.  
- **Customer Engagement:** Introduce loyalty rewards for Corporate and Home Office customers.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimise shipping modes to balance **cost** and **speed**.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Continuously track KPIs and customer behaviour.

- Sales performance  
- Customer segmentation  
- Product insights  

Key strengths: Technology, Office Supplies, West/East regions  
Growth opportunities: South region, Corporate segment, underperforming product lines
