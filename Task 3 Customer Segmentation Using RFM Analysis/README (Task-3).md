# Task 3 â€“ Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## Introduction
This task focuses on **customer segmentation** using the **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model**.  
The objective was to identify distinct customer groups based on past purchasing behaviour and provide actionable insights for **targeted marketing** and **retention strategies**.

---

## Methodology: RFM Analysis
The **RFM model** is a data-driven approach that classifies customers using three key metrics:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes purchases  
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends  

By scoring customers on each dimension, meaningful segments were created to analyse behaviour and value.

## Key Findings & Customer Segments
The analysis revealed five distinct customer groups:

1. **Champions**  
   - High scores in Recency, Frequency, and Monetary  
   - Most valuable customers, highly engaged, and loyal  

2. **Loyal Customers** 
   - High Frequency & Monetary scores, slightly lower Recency  
   - Consistent buyers, good candidates for **upsell and personalised offers**  

3. **At-Risk Customers** 
   - Previously high Frequency & Monetary scores, but low Recency  
   - Critical to re-engage before they move to competitors  

4. **New Customers** 
   - High Recency, low Frequency & Monetary  
   - Early in their journey, requiring **onboarding and nurturing**  

5. **Lost Customers**  
   - Low across all three metrics  
   - Difficult to retain, better to focus resources on high-value groups
